This is my sample Pokemon app.  The main function of the app is to select
different Pokemon characters and view their respective attributes.  The Pokemon
image is also available so users are able to get a visual of how each Pokemon
look.  

The languages used in the app are: Javascript, jquery, html and css.

The app uses Bootstrap code.  Each Pokemon is displayed by clicking the respective
button and using Bootstraps modal.  The modal allows the user to isolate each
Pokemon that is clicked by opening a small screen(modal) and displaying the
information.
