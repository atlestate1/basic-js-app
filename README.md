This is a small Pokemon application.  This app shows users short descriptions of
Pokemon characters.  Users can click on a Pokemon name and a separate screen will
appear, showing the character's attributes.  The screen or modal, isolates the
character that is clicked so the user can focus on the chosen Pokemon character.

The languages used for this application are: CSS, HTML, Javascript ES6 (which loads
  data from an external API ).  Extras include jQuery and bootstrap. The bootstrap
  modal is used for this project.
